What is Green Hash ?
Green Hash is a web-based civic-tech platform designed to bridge the gap between citizens and local municipal authorities in managing urban waste more efficiently.

It empowers everyday users to report waste in their locality by simply uploading a photo. The platform automatically geotags the location, pins it on a live map, and sends the report to the respective municipal admin for action.

Key Features:
Waste Photo Reporting: Users can take and upload a photo of waste directly from any device.

Geo-tagged Submissions: Reports are automatically pinned on an interactive map.

Live Status Tracking: Citizens can track the progress of their report — whether it’s pending, being worked on, or cleaned.

Admin Dashboard: Municipal authorities get a clean interface to view, filter, and update waste cases.

Transparency: All users can see waste issues in their area and how long they remain unresolved.

Data-Driven Governance: Admins can identify high-density waste zones, track cleanup performance, and generate civic insights.
